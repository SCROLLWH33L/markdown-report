# High-Level Summary

John Doe was tasked with performing an internal penetration test towards Offensive Security Labs. An internal penetration test is a dedicated attack against internally connected systems. The focus of this test is to perform attacks, similar to those of a hacker and attempt to infiltrate Offensive Security’s internal lab systems – the THINC.local domain. John’s overall objective was to evaluate the network, identify systems, and exploit flaws while reporting the findings back to Offensive Security.

When performing the internal penetration test, there were several alarming vulnerabilities that were identified on Offensive Security’s network. When performing the attacks, John was able to gain access to multiple machines, primarily due to outdated patches and poor security configurations.  During the testing, John had administrative level access to multiple systems. All systems were successfully exploited and access granted. 

## Recommendations

John recommends patching the vulnerabilities identified during the testing to ensure that an attacker cannot exploit these systems in the future. One thing to remember is that these systems require frequent patching and once patched, should remain on a regular patch program to protect additional vulnerabilities that are discovered at a later date.
